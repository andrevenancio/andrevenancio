### Hi there 👋

Hello 👋🏻 my name is André, and I'm a creative developer and judget at the [FWA](https://thefwa.com). I'm currently ~~living~~ self isolating in London🇬🇧

The projects I can share, they end up in here, so have a look around. Its a bit of a mess from a WebGL2.0 3D engine to React stuff, there's a bit of everything here. One day when I'm famous I'll tidy things up so I look like I know what I'm doing.

Sometimes I [tweet](https://twitter.com/andrevenancio), sometimes I [eat](https://www.instagram.com/_andrevenancio/).
I'm into [Creative Coding](https://creative-coding.com) and [music](https://mod-synth.io)
